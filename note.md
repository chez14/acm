Hi Futured Chris,

Here's some reference to make your own MD to PDF js Machine.

You've decided to use `js` since it's your fav lang, now. Your old Chris were kind enough to gives you some refs. so please, hear his refs.

- [Concater](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-concat-callback)
- [MD to PDF](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-pdf)
- [Merging PDFs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-merge) but it will need [this kind of transpiler](https://artandlogic.com/2014/05/a-simple-gulp-plugin/).

Oh one more, you'll need Gulp, since it's better that way. Have a restless day, Chris.
